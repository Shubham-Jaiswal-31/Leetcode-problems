## Problem Description

```
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

Example 3:
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
 
Constraints:
	2 <= nums.length <= 104
	-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
	-109 <= target <= 109
	Only one valid answer exists.
```

## Code

Python Code:
```py
# This method uses hash-tables to reduce time complexity
# It saves time but increases space requirements
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        # create an empty dictionary to store a hash table with number as key
        # and its index in list as value
        hashmap = {}
        # iterate over the nums
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            # find the difference of target and current number
            difference = target - nums[i]
            # if the difference is also present in hashmap, we got the answer
            if difference in hashmap:
                # return the current number and the difference
                return [hashmap[difference], i]
            # otherwise add current number: index as item in hash-table
            hashmap[nums[i]] = i
```
